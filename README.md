# NaatyaVerse 🎭  
**AI-powered posture correction in classical dance (Prototype)**  

---

## 📌 Overview  
NaatyaVerse explores how **AI and pose estimation** can support classical dance training by providing **real-time feedback** on posture and alignment.  
This project aims to blend **technology and culture**, building tools that help dancers refine their poses with the aid of computer vision.  

---

## ✨ Prototype Goals  
- Detect body posture using **pose estimation**  
- Compare dancer’s pose with a **reference pose**  
- Provide **feedback** (e.g., “lift left arm higher”) in real time  
- Explore applications in **Indian classical dance** (starting with Bharatanatyam)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for video/webcam input)  
- **MediaPipe** (for human pose detection)  
- **Streamlit** *(optional, for UI demo)*  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap  
- [ ] Stage 1: Set up webcam + detect human skeleton with MediaPipe  
- [ ] Stage 2: Save and compare dancer’s pose with reference poses  
- [ ] Stage 3: Give posture feedback (e.g., angle differences)  
- [ ] Stage 4: Add cultural dance pose dataset + extend feedback

## 🎯 Vision  
To create an AI assistant that helps dancers improve their posture, preserve cultural heritage, and make classical dance more accessible in the digital era.  

---

## 💡 Inspiration  
Classical dance requires years of practice to perfect posture and alignment. With AI and pose estimation, we can provide learners with real-time feedback, making practice sessions more effective — and ensuring that cultural art forms evolve with technology.
